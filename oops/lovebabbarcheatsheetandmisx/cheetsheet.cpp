// Q1 Is it possible for a class to inherit the constructor of its base class ?
// ->  derived class cannot inherit the constructor of the base class 



//Q2 super keyword
//-> used to refer the parent class objects


//Q3 order of constructor and destructor calling sequence in case of various inheritance schemes.
// -> For multiple inheritance order of constructor call is, the base class’s constructors are called in the order of inheritance and then the derived class’s constructor. 
// -> for destructor it is opposite

// Singleton pattern example.
//Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.
